# Vapor Testing Template

A template for starting a new Vapor web application with testing in mind.

## Usage

The recommended use for this template is to create a new Vapor app using the Vapor Toolbox. When creating a new web app with the toolbox, you can specify this template as an option, like so:

```
vapor new 'MyApp' --template=https://github.com/gtranchedone/vapor-testing-template
```

Alternatively, you can simply clone this project and start working on your app. This template is actually a fully working Vapor application, although quite basic in functionality.

## Running tests

Once you've created a new app, you can run tests using `vapor test` or `swift test`. Both commands are equivalent at this point. See the example tests included with the template to get started.

## ðŸ“– Vapor Documentation

Visit the Vapor web framework's [documentation](http://docs.vapor.codes) for instructions on how to build a web application using this template.

## ðŸ”§ Compatibility

This package has been tested on macOS and Ubuntu.
